# hole-digger

Actual project code is contained in `Assets/_Game/Scripts/`

The gameplay part - everything related to [LevelView](Assets/_Game/Scripts/Game/Level/LevelView.cs) and [LevelDiggingController](Assets/_Game/Scripts/Game/Level/Digging/LevelDiggingController.cs) - was written in a hurry
during the prototyping phase and does not represent the average code quality of the project.
